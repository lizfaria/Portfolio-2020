I'm a software developer from Toronto specializing in JavaScript, React and CSS. Previously, I worked at an digital design agency called <a href="https://designtennis.com/about/" target="_blank">Tennis</a> creating innovative websites for education, arts, science, technology and business organizations. I build my websites with a strong focus on organized code, performance, accessibility and responsiveness. 

There is an infinite possibility for creative contribution in software development. After four years studying the liberal arts and exposing myself to the oldest philosophic ideas in Western history, what I love about development is its absence of constraints, how far it is from being finished, and that developers can bring it to life however they want. Other developers stretch my imagination of what is possible everyday and I want to be part of expanding possibilities and creating quality content that improves people's online experience.
