I'm based in Toronto and specialize in JavaScript, React, Node and CSS. I am a Full Stack Engineer at Ownr, an industry-leading RBC Ventures app that helps entrepreneurs create and manage their businesses by automating legal tasks. Previously, I worked at TouchBistro as a Full-Stack Developer on the Insights and Reporting team, building and improving venue reporting solutions using point-of-sale data. I also worked at a digital design agency called <a href="https://designtennis.com/about/" target="_blank">Tennis</a> creating innovative websites for major education, arts, science, technology and business organizations. 

I build my websites and applications with a strong focus on maintainability, accessibility, performance, and responsiveness. I work hard because I want to contribute to expanding possibilities and creating high quality content and online experiences for everyone.

I'm happy when I'm connecting with others to try to understand and solve problems. This has been fostered in my past pursuits facilitating wilderness and art therapy experiences for youth, and studying continental philosophy and sociology.
