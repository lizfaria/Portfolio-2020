      This React Native Application gets colour palettes from artist Matt
      DesLauriers' github raw files and displays them in screens for users to
      view. Users can customize their own palette using aggregated colors from
      the palettes on a modal form.

      For the final group project for Bridge, I collaborated in a team of four
      to build a test-driven application in React and Redux that fulfilled
      requirements posed by a product owner. Requirements included allowing
      users to create and fill out application forms with different questions
      types. For the backend, we used Node to get and post data to firebase
      database. We also used deployment services like Netlify and Heroku for
      continous deployment of integrated code on Github.

      This app is currently installed on iPads at the Textile Museum of Canada
      to pair with the ᖃᓪᓗᓈᖅᑕᐃᑦ ᓯᑯᓯᓛᕐᒥᑦ PRINTED TEXTILES FROM KINNGAIT STUDIOS
      exhibit. It displays all objects at the exhibit and features hotspots on
      each object page that users can interact with to open multimedia models
      with more information. A requirement of the app was for it to provide
      support for offline experience and bad network connections. For this
      reason, it is built as a Progressive Web App - it uses a service worker to
      cache data.

      A personal project that allows you to search a GitHub username and
      displays that user's information from Github Events API. 


      On change of input, a Redux action is triggered to store the new username
      state in the redux store, and on submit, a dispatch is triggered to call
      the Redux thunk. The thunk Async/Await function calls the Github API
      Events Endpoint to get the information associated with the username. If an
      invalid username is searched, an action is dispatched, prompting a form
      error. Otherwise, when user information has been returned with a status of
      OK, the thunk dispatches two actions: One to hide the form, and another to
      save the 30 most recent events in an array. I filter through the array
      twice to display the github username with two lists: the most recent
      repositories (repos) forked by the username provided and their most recent
      pull requests. This is a Test Driven Development App. There are tests for
      all of the components, reducers, and helper functions. It is styled with
      CSS and Styled-Components

      Awarded an honorable mention from Awwwards, this annual report site
      features a MP3 player that is linked to every song button across different
      pages on the site. Using HTML5 DOM methods, properties, and events, users
      can select which songs to play, and automatically play the next
      consecutive song on the playlist when the current song ends. Whenever a
      user navigates to an internal page, the page is loaded into a div, so the
      page does not refresh and the media player continues playing music without
      interruption. This site also uses slick to achieve an interesting
      slideshow with refraction and window blinds effects.

      New Harvest's 2019 conference website is a stunning interactive single
      page site that includes a parallax animation of the header on scroll, a
      smooth and unique navigation animation and clever hover/click states to
      reveal more information of speakers and schedules. The video modal on this
      site connects to the YouTube API in order to start the video when a user
      opens the video modal, and pause the video when they close it.

      Fetching filtered data from Google Maps and Refuge APIs according to user
      location and form inputs, this site helps users find wheelchair accessible
      and gender-neutral washrooms. I collaborated on this app with a classmate
      for the first JavaScript project at the Juno Web Development Bootcamp in
      Spring 2017. Although the code is not perfect, I am very proud of the idea
      and look behind the app. In the future, I would like to refactor this app
      to include cleaner code, draw from more reliable data and allow for user
      feedback.
