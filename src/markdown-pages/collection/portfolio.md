      For the final group project for Bridge, I was put in a team of four to
      build an test-driven application built in React and Redux that fulfilled
      requirements posed by a product owner. Requirements included allowing
      users to create and fill out application forms with different questions
      types. We used backend Node to get and post data to firebase database. We
      also used deployment services like Netlify and Heroku for continous
      deployment of integrated code on Github.

      This app is currently installed on iPads at the Textile Museum of Canada
      to pair with the ᖃᓪᓗᓈᖅᑕᐃᑦ ᓯᑯᓯᓛᕐᒥᑦ PRINTED TEXTILES FROM KINNGAIT STUDIOS
      exhibit. It displays all objects at the exhibit and features hotspots on
      each object page that users can interact with to open multimedia models
      with more information. A requirment of the app was for it to provide
      support for offline experience and bad network connections. For this
      reason, it is built as a Progressive Web App - it uses a service worker to
      cache data.

      The annual report site features a MP3 player that is linked to every song
      button across different pages on the site. Using HTML5 DOM methods,
      properties, and events, users can select which songs to play, and
      automatically play the next consecutive song on the playlist when the
      current song ends. Whenever a user navigates to an internal page, the page
      is loaded into a div, so the page does not refresh and the media player
      continues playing music without interruption. This site also uses slick to
      achieve an interesting slideshow with refraction and window blinds
      effects.

      New Harvest's 2019 conference website is a stunning interactive single
      page site that includes a parallax animation of the header on scroll, a
      smooth and unique navigation animation and clever hover/click states to
      reveal more information of speakers and schedules. The video modal on this
      site connects to the YouTube API in order to start the video when a user
      opens the video modal, and pause the video when they close it.
