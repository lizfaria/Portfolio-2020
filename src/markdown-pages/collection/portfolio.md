      For the final group project for Bridge, I was put in a team of four to
      build an test-driven application built in React and Redux that fulfilled
      requirements posed by a product owner. Requirements included allowing
      users to create and fill out application forms with different questions
      types. We used backend Node to get and post data to firebase database. We
      also used deployment services like Netlify and Heroku for continous
      deployment of integrated code on Github.

      This app is currently installed on iPads at the Textile Museum of Canada
      to pair with the ᖃᓪᓗᓈᖅᑕᐃᑦ ᓯᑯᓯᓛᕐᒥᑦ PRINTED TEXTILES FROM KINNGAIT STUDIOS
      exhibit. It displays all objects at the exhibit and features hotspots on
      each object page that users can interact with to open multimedia models
      with more information. A requirment of the app was for it to provide
      support for offline experience and bad network connections. For this
      reason, it is built as a Progressive Web App - it uses a service worker to
      cache data.
