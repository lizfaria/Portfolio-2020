      For the final group project for Bridge, I was put in a team of four to
      build an test-driven application built in React and Redux that fulfilled
      requirements posed by a product owner. Requirements included allowing
      users to create and fill out application forms with different questions
      types. We used backend Node to get and post data to firebase database. We
      also used deployment services like Netlify and Heroku for continous
      deployment of integrated code on Github.
